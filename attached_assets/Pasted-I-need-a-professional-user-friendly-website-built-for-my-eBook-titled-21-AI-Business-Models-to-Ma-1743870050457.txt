I need a professional, user-friendly website built for my eBook, titled '21 AI Business Models to Make Passive Income Online in 2025: A Step-by-Step Guide to Leveraging AI for Digital Success.' The website’s primary goal is to promote and sell the eBook via Gumroad while also providing valuable resources and building an email list for future marketing. The site should appeal to entrepreneurs, freelancers, content creators, social media marketers, Etsy/KDP sellers, bloggers, and beginners interested in passive income through AI-driven businesses in 2025.

Website Purpose and Target Audience:

Purpose: To serve as a digital storefront for the eBook, offering a compelling landing page, detailed book information, testimonials, a blog for free resources, and an email signup form to capture leads. The site should drive sales and establish credibility for the book.
Target Audience: Forward-thinking individuals aged 20-45, including entrepreneurs seeking passive income, freelancers offering AI-based services, content creators, online business owners, social media marketers, Etsy/KDP sellers, bloggers, and beginners with little to no tech experience. They are tech-savvy, value actionable insights, and are motivated to achieve financial freedom.
Key Features and Pages:

Homepage (Landing Page):
A visually striking hero section with the book title, subtitle ('A Step-by-Step Guide to Leveraging AI for Digital Success'), and a high-quality book cover image (to be provided or generated).
A clear call-to-action (CTA) button linking to the Gumroad purchase page (e.g., 'Buy Now for $47').
A brief overview of the book’s value proposition: 'Unlock 21 AI-powered business models to build passive income in 2025—no tech skills needed!'
Social proof: Include 3-5 testimonials from readers (e.g., 'This book helped me earn $5K/month in 90 days!' – Jake, YouTuber).
An email signup form (e.g., 'Join 10,000+ Entrepreneurs – Get a Free AI Tools Checklist!') integrated with Mailchimp or ConvertKit.
About the Book Page:
A detailed description of the book, summarizing its 21 chapters (e.g., faceless YouTube channels, AI audiobooks, Instagram growth hacks).
Highlight key benefits: step-by-step guides, essential AI tools (ChatGPT, Canva, Eleven Labs), monetization strategies, automation techniques, and case studies.
Include a table of contents with clickable links to brief chapter summaries.
Add a 'Buy Now' CTA linking to Gumroad.
Blog/Resources Page:
A blog section with 3-5 preloaded articles offering free value (e.g., 'Top 5 AI Tools for Beginners in 2025', 'How to Start a Faceless YouTube Channel').
Each article should include a CTA to buy the book or join the email list.
Use a clean, grid-style layout for easy navigation.
Contact Page:
A simple contact form for inquiries, integrated with a service like Formspree.
Links to social media profiles (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn) and an email address (e.g., support@yourdomain.com).
Footer:
Include links to all main pages, social media, a privacy policy, and terms of service (generate generic versions if needed).
Add a small email signup form for consistency.
Design Preferences:

Visual Style: Modern, tech-inspired, and professional with a futuristic vibe. Use clean lines, minimalistic layouts, and a focus on readability.
Color Scheme: Navy blue, teal, and electric blue as primary colors (reflecting AI and innovation), with white, silver, and gold accents for CTAs and highlights.
Typography: Use a bold, sans-serif font for headings (e.g., Montserrat or Poppins) and a clean, readable font for body text (e.g., Open Sans or Roboto). Ensure fonts are legible on all devices.
Imagery: Incorporate subtle tech elements like circuit patterns, holographic effects, or AI brain visuals. Use mockups of the book cover prominently (e.g., 3D render of the eBook on a laptop or tablet).
Responsiveness: The site must be fully responsive, looking great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Technical Requirements:

Framework: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight, fast-loading site. Frameworks like React or Next.js are acceptable if they improve performance.
Hosting: Ensure compatibility with hosting platforms like Netlify or Vercel for easy deployment (recommend deployment steps if possible).
Integrations:
Gumroad for eBook sales (embed a 'Buy Now' button linking to the Gumroad product page).
Mailchimp or ConvertKit for email capture (include a signup form with a freebie offer).
Google Analytics for tracking site traffic and user behavior.
SEO Optimization: Optimize for search engines with meta tags, alt text for images, and keywords like 'AI passive income 2025', 'AI business models', and 'make money online with AI'.
Performance: Ensure the site loads in under 3 seconds, with compressed images and minimal scripts.
Additional Features:

Social Proof: Add a live counter (e.g., 'Join 5,000+ Readers') to build trust.
Sticky Header: Include a navigation bar with links to Home, About the Book, Blog, and Contact, with a 'Buy Now' button that remains visible while scrolling.
Pop-Up: Add a non-intrusive pop-up after 10 seconds offering a 10% discount code for the eBook (e.g., 'SAVE10') to encourage immediate purchases.
Accessibility: Ensure the site is WCAG 2.1 compliant (e.g., alt text, keyboard navigation, high-contrast text).
Tone and Messaging:

The tone should be professional yet approachable, inspiring confidence and excitement. Use phrases like 'Unlock Your Financial Future', 'Step-by-Step Simplicity', and 'Powered by AI' to emphasize the book’s value.
Highlight the ease of use for beginners and the scalability for advanced users to appeal to a broad audience.
Deliverables:

A fully functional website with all pages, features, and integrations as described.
Source code in a GitHub repository or downloadable zip file.
A brief readme file with instructions for deployment, updating content, and managing integrations.
A preview link to view the live site before final delivery.
Timeline and Budget:

I’d like the website completed within 5-7 days, if possible.
My budget is flexible but ideally under $200 (or equivalent in Bolt.new/Replit credits). Please prioritize cost-effective solutions without compromising quality.
Additional Notes:

If you need placeholder content (e.g., testimonials, blog posts), generate realistic examples based on the book’s themes.
Ensure the design aligns with the book’s cover (a futuristic, tech-inspired aesthetic with navy blue, teal, and gold accents).
If any clarification is needed, please prompt for details rather than making assumptions.
Thank you for building this website—I’m excited to see it come to life and start selling my eBook to a global audience!"
